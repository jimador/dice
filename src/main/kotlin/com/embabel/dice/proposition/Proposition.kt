/**
 * A proposition is a natural language statement with typed entity mentions.
 * Propositions are the system of record - all other representations
 * (Neo4j relationships, Prolog facts, vector embeddings) derive from them.
 *
 * **Design: One Proposition = One Relationship**
 *
 * Each proposition should express a single fact with at most two entity mentions
 * (SUBJECT and OBJECT). This maps cleanly to graph relationships during promotion.
 * Complex sentences with multiple relationships should be extracted as multiple
 * propositions during the extraction phase.
 *
 * @property id Unique identifier for this proposition
 * @property contextId The context in which this proposition is relevant
 * @property text The statement in natural language (e.g., "Jim is an expert in GOAP")
 * @property mentions Entity references within the text (typically 1-2, with SUBJECT/OBJECT roles)
 * @property confidence LLM-generated certainty (0.0-1.0)
 * @property decay Staleness rate (0.0-1.0). High decay = information becomes stale quickly
 * @property importance How much this fact matters (0.0-1.0). Orthogonal to confidence.
 * @property reasoning LLM explanation for why this was extracted
 * @property grounding Chunk IDs that support this proposition
 * @property created When the proposition was first created
 * @property contentRevised When the proposition's content last changed (text, mentions,
 *   confidence). This is the decay anchor: [effectiveConfidence] measures age from here.
 * @property metadataRevised When the proposition's administrative metadata last changed
 *   (status, grounding, temporal, pinned). Does NOT reset the decay clock.
 * @property pinned When true, the proposition is exempt from decay-driven sweeps
 *   (a sweep-protected tier). Defaults to false.
 * @property status Current lifecycle status
 * @property level Abstraction level: 0 = raw observation, 1+ = derived abstraction
 * @property sourceIds IDs of propositions this was abstracted from (empty for level 0)
 * @property reinforceCount How many times this proposition has been merged or reinforced.
 *   Provides a frequency/importance signal complementary to confidence and decay.
 * @property temporal Optional bitemporal metadata (observed/valid time, supersession,
 *   contradiction). Null when temporal correctness is not tracked for this proposition.
 * @property provenanceEntries Rich grounding entries linking this proposition to source
 *   material via [com.embabel.dice.provenance.SourceLocator]. Complements the legacy
 *   chunk-id-only [grounding] list.
