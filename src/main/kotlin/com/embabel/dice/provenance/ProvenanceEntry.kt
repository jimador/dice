package com.embabel.dice.provenance

/**
 * Links a proposition to the source material it was derived from.
 *
 * Each entry carries a [SourceLocator] identifying where the material lives,
 * together with optional detail locating the content within that source: the
 * originating chunk, a character offset range, and a content hash. This rich
 * provenance carries more detail than a bare list of chunk IDs.
 *
 * All detail beyond the [locator] is optional, so coarse provenance (the source
 * document) and precise provenance (a character range within a chunk) share a
 * single representation.
 *
 * @property locator Reference to where the source material lives
 * @property chunkId Optional ID of the chunk this provenance came from
 * @property startOffset Optional inclusive start character offset within the source/chunk
 * @property endOffset Optional exclusive end character offset within the source/chunk
 * @property contentHash Optional hash of the source content. Comparing it against the
 *   source later can reveal that the source has since changed.
