/**
 * Consolidation pass that synthesizes higher-level propositions from groups of related ground-level
 * propositions by delegating to an injected [PropositionAbstractor].
 *
 * This pass does NOT re-implement abstraction — it groups level-0 ACTIVE snapshot propositions by
 * resolved entity, hands each qualifying group to the abstractor, and marks the consumed sources
 * `SUPERSEDED`. It adds only pass-level concerns: snapshot filtering, an idempotency guard, and a
 * `maxLevel` cap.
 *
 * ## Why the idempotency guard exists
 *
 * Without a guard, every cycle would re-abstract the same groups, producing fresh higher-level
 * propositions whose own sources are then re-abstracted again — unbounded level inflation that never
 * settles. The guard skips a group whenever an existing higher-level proposition already covers all of
 * the group's member IDs (`sourceIds.containsAll(memberIds)`), so a re-run over an unchanged snapshot
 * is a [ConsolidationPassResult.NoOp]. The `maxLevel` cap is a secondary safeguard that drops any
 * abstraction whose resulting level exceeds the configured ceiling.
 *
 * @property abstractor The delegate that synthesizes higher-level propositions for a group.
 * @property abstractionThreshold Minimum group size before a group is eligible for abstraction.
 * @property abstractionTargetCount Desired number of abstractions per group, passed to the abstractor.
 * @property maxLevel Highest abstraction level permitted; abstractions above this are discarded.
