/**
 * One composable step in a consolidation cycle. A pass receives the current snapshot of
 * propositions for a context, decides what should change, and reports it back as a
 * [ConsolidationPassResult] — it never writes anything itself.
 *
 * ## Purity contract
 *
 * A pass works only with the snapshot it is handed and never touches a repository directly.
 * The orchestrator owns all writes: it fetches the snapshot once, runs each pass over it,
 * and applies the accumulated saves/deletes in a single write per cycle.
 *
 * Passes MUST be idempotent: running the same pass twice with no intervening write must produce
 * [ConsolidationPassResult.NoOp] on the second run. The consolidation loop runs passes
 * repeatedly until the snapshot settles, so a pass that keeps returning [ConsolidationPassResult.Changed]
 * for an already-consolidated snapshot would loop forever.
 *
 * Implement this interface to add domain-specific consolidation behavior without touching DICE core.
