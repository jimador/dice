/**
 * Consolidation pass that resolves contradictions among ACTIVE propositions by delegating
 * classification to an injected [PropositionReviser] and retiring the losing side of each conflict.
 *
 * This pass does NOT re-implement contradiction detection. For each ACTIVE proposition it asks
 * `reviser.classify()` to compare it against its entity-overlapping ACTIVE peers; for every pair the
 * reviser reports as [PropositionRelation.CONTRADICTORY], the weaker member (lower
 * [Proposition.effectiveConfidence]; ties favor the proposition being classified) is transitioned to
 * [PropositionStatus.CONTRADICTED].
 *
 * Classification uses [PropositionReviser.classify] — NOT a contraster — because resolving a
 * contradiction is a lifecycle transition, not an articulation of differences.
 *
 * ## Idempotency
 *
 * Only ACTIVE propositions are compared and only an ACTIVE loser is transitioned, so once a conflict
 * is resolved the retired proposition drops out of the candidate set and is never re-classified. A
 * re-run over an already-resolved snapshot therefore yields [ConsolidationPassResult.NoOp]. Candidates
 * are pruned to those sharing at least one resolved entity, bounding `classify()` fan-out.
 *
 * @property reviser The delegate that classifies the relation between propositions.
