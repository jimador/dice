/**
 * A [TrustScorer] that scores a proposition purely by the authority of its source: more
 * authoritative tiers get a higher trust score. This is the natural step up from
 * [NeutralTrustScorer] for consumers who want "trust the source" behaviour without writing their
 * own model.
 *
 * The tier-to-score mapping is fully configurable — pass your own [weights] to retune it, or rely
 * on the [DEFAULT_WEIGHTS] below. A tier that is missing from the map (or a `null` tier, e.g. when
 * authority could not be resolved) scores [unknownScore]. Conflict type is ignored by default;
 * subclasses can override [score] to factor it in. Every score is clamped to `[0.0, 1.0]` so a
 * mis-tuned map can never produce an out-of-range value.
 *
 * @property weights trust score per authority tier
 * @property unknownScore score used when the tier is `null` or absent from [weights]
