/**
 * Represents something derived from sources with associated uncertainty.
 *
 * A Derivation captures the epistemic properties of derived knowledge:
 * - **Confidence**: How certain we are (0.0 = uncertain, 1.0 = certain)
 * - **Importance**: How much this fact matters (0.0 = trivial, 1.0 = critical)
 * - **Decay**: How quickly it becomes stale (0.0 = eternal, 1.0 = ephemeral)
 * - **Grounding**: What sources support this derivation
 *
 * Both [Proposition]s (raw extracted knowledge) and [Projection] items
 * (derived representations) implement this interface, enabling uniform
 * handling of uncertain, traceable knowledge.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * fun processDerivation(d: Derivation) {
 *     if (d.confidence > 0.8 && d.decay < 0.3) {
 *         // High confidence, low decay - reliable long-term knowledge
 *         storeInLongTermMemory(d)
 *     }
 *     if (d.importance > 0.8) {
 *         // High importance - prioritise regardless of confidence
 *         flagForAttention(d)
 *     }
 *     // Trace back to sources
 *     d.grounding.forEach { sourceId ->
 *         log("Derived from: $sourceId")
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
