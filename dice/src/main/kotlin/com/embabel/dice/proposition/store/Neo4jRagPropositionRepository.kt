/**
 * Reference proposition store that backs persistence through Embabel's
 * [NamedEntityDataRepository] SPI — which is Neo4j-backed at runtime in a typical deployment,
 * hence the descriptive name — without ever importing a graph driver or emitting Cypher from
 * production code. The store stays hexagonal: it talks to the SPI port, and the consuming
 * application supplies whatever concrete (Neo4j or otherwise) implementation it likes.
 *
 * ## Composition
 *
 * Propositions are not native graph nodes — the entity SPI stores `NamedEntityData`, not
 * [Proposition]. This adapter therefore composes two collaborators:
 *
 * - [crud]: a supplementary durable [PropositionStore] that actually holds the [Proposition]
 *   objects (CRUD, identity, the composable [query]). All base-port members delegate here.
 * - [entityRepository]: the entity/vector/relationship backend the consumer supplies. It backs
 *   the separate entity-axis projection/reconciliation path; it is held here as a real collaborator but
 *   is deliberately never exposed in this store's public signatures, so no SPI-only type leaks
 *   into the proposition contract.
 *
 * ## Declared capabilities (honest fragments only)
 *
 * The store declares exactly [PropositionStore] and [VectorSearchCapable]. Every
 * [VectorSearchCapable] member — both [findSimilarWithScores] overloads and [findClusters] — is
 * forwarded to the supplementary store when that store is itself vector-capable, so any
 * backend-pushed-down filtering or clustering override on the supplementary store is honoured
 * rather than bypassed. When the supplementary store is not vector-capable, every vector member
 * degrades to an empty result. None of these paths is ever wired to the SPI's entity
 * `vectorSearch`, which operates on a different axis (entities, not propositions) and would be
 * semantically wrong.
 *
 * ## Why graph and temporal capabilities are omitted
 *
 * The proposition capability fragments (`GraphTraversalCapable` for the abstraction hierarchy,
 * `TemporalQueryCapable` for time-window/effective-confidence queries) are proposition-scoped,
 * whereas the [NamedEntityDataRepository] SPI is entity-scoped — the proposition-vs-entity axis
 * mismatch. The SPI exposes only 1-hop entity navigation (`findRelated`) and no temporal surface,
 * so neither proposition fragment can be served honestly here. Declaring a fragment this store
 * cannot back would make a caller's `supportsGraph` report `true` while results came back empty —
 * dishonest. Omission is the honest
 * signal: a caller using `PropositionStoreTemplate` sees `supportsGraph == false` and gets empty,
 * typed results from the graph/temporal paths, never an exception. Full multi-hop / path-between
 * traversal is deferred to a future native graph-query adapter.
 *
 * @param crud the supplementary durable proposition store backing all CRUD and query operations
 * @param entityRepository the entity/relationship/vector backend supplied by the consumer; held
 *   for the entity-axis projection path and never surfaced in this store's public signatures
