/**
 * Controls how the [PropositionPipeline] dispatches the stateless per-chunk extraction stage.
 * Implementations choose serial or concurrent execution; the resolution stage (entity resolution)
 * always runs serially regardless of the strategy, preserving cross-chunk entity identity.
 *
 * ## Contract
 * - **Input order is preserved**: the returned list has exactly `chunks.size` elements and
 *   `result[i]` corresponds to `chunks[i]` (or `null` if extraction of `chunks[i]` failed).
 * - **Failure is a `null` slot**: when `extract(chunk)` throws, that slot becomes `null` rather
 *   than propagating the exception. The pipeline maps a `null` slot to a
 *   [ChunkPropositionResult.Failed]. No element is ever dropped or reordered.
 *
 * ## Executor ownership
 * Each implementation owns its execution mechanism. The [execute] signature intentionally
 * does not mention [ExecutorService] — any executor is an injected implementation detail.
 * A caller-supplied executor is never shut down by the strategy — its lifecycle stays the
 * caller's. When a strategy creates its own pool (the no-executor constructors), that pool is
 * the strategy's to clean up: both concurrent strategies are [AutoCloseable], and [close]
 * shuts down only an internally-created pool.
 *
 * ## Thread-safety gate for production
 * The default is [SerialExtractionStrategy] (no concurrency). Before switching to
 * [ParallelExtractionStrategy] or [BatchedExtractionStrategy] with `batchSize > 1`, verify
 * that the `Ai` implementation backing your `PropositionExtractor` is thread-safe for
 * concurrent `extract()` calls. Until then, `BatchedExtractionStrategy(batchSize = 1)` is
 * the safe degrade-to-serial path.
 *
 * Note: this is a plain `interface` rather than a `fun interface` because Kotlin SAM
 * conversion does not support abstract methods with their own type parameters (`fun <T> execute(...)`).
