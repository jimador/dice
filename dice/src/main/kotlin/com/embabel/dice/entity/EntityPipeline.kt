/**
 * Pipeline for extracting and resolving entities from chunks.
 *
 * This is a simpler alternative to [PropositionPipeline] when you only need
 * entity extraction without proposition creation.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```kotlin
 * val pipeline = EntityPipeline
 *     .withExtractor(LlmEntityExtractor.withLlm(llmOptions).withAi(ai))
 *
 * val result = pipeline.processChunk(chunk, context)
 * entityRepository.saveAll(result.entitiesToPersist())
 * ```
 *
 * This pipeline does NOT persist anything. It returns an [EntityResults]
 * containing all extracted entities. The caller is responsible for
 * persisting these to the appropriate repository.
 *
 * @param extractor The entity extractor to use
