/**
 * Portable facade giving consumers a graph view over proposition data without requiring a graph
 * backend.
 *
 * Entity neighbourhoods and paths are derived store-agnostically from repeated 1-hop proposition
 * queries: a proposition that mentions two resolved entities IS the edge between them. Proposition
 * lineage is assembled from the proposition's own durable fields. When the wrapped store declares
 * [GraphQueryCapable], each operation routes to that native override instead; otherwise the
 * portable default bodies run. Operations never throw for a missing capability — they degrade to
 * empty/typed/null results.
 *
 * Traversal is bounded by [maxDepth] and guarded by a visited set so cyclic data terminates.
 *
 * @param store the backing proposition store
 * @param contextId optional scope; when present, queries are confined to this context
 * @param maxDepth hop ceiling for the default-body neighbourhood/path traversal; must be >= 1
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if [maxDepth] is less than 1
