/**

 * so you can project propositions to graph relationships and persist them in one call.
 *
 * @param graphProjector converts propositions to relationships
 * @param persister writes those relationships to the graph
 * @param schema data dictionary used for relationship validation
 * @param recordStore optional lineage store; when supplied, one [ProjectionRecord] is
 *   written per result (PROJECTED / ADOPTED / SKIPPED / FAILED). Nothing is recorded
 *   when null.
 * @param reconciler decides per successful projection whether to create a new artifact
 *   (PROJECTED) or align with an existing one (ADOPTED). Defaults to [AlwaysCreateReconciler].
 *   Only consulted when a [recordStore] is present. Node-level de-duplication on the
 *   graph side is a planned follow-up.
