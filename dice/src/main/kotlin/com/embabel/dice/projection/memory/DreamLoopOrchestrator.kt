/**
 * Composes [ConsolidationPass]es into a repeatable consolidation cycle — the "dream loop".
 *
 * Each cycle fetches the ACTIVE snapshot for a context once, runs every registered pass over
 * it in registration order, aggregates what all passes want to save into a single write, and
 * returns a [DreamLoopReport]. Passes are pure; only the orchestrator writes to the repository.
 *
 * There are two ways to trigger a cycle:
 * - [consolidate] is threshold-gated and returns `null` when not enough has changed.
 * - [consolidateNow] always runs regardless of how much has changed.
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * val orchestrator = DefaultDreamLoopOrchestrator.withRepository(repository)
 *     .withPass(sessionConsolidationPass)
 *     .withPass(abstractionPass)
 *     .withPass(contradictionResolutionPass)
 *     .withPass(decaySweepPass)
 *
 * // Scheduled / threshold-gated: may return null if little has changed.
 * val maybeReport = orchestrator.consolidate(contextId)
 *
 * // Always runs.
 * val report = orchestrator.consolidateNow(contextId)
 * ```
