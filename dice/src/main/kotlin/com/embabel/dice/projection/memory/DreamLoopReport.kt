/**
 * Summary of a single dream-loop consolidation cycle.
 *
 * Holds the result from every pass that ran, plus roll-up totals for how many propositions
 * were examined, changed, or newly created.
 *
 * @property contextId The context the cycle ran for.
 * @property cycleStarted When the cycle began.
 * @property cycleCompleted When the cycle finished; defaults to construction time.
 * @property passResults Each pass's result, in registration (execution) order.
 * @property totalExamined How many propositions were in the ACTIVE snapshot.
 * @property totalTransitioned How many propositions had their status or content changed across all passes.
 * @property totalNewPropositions How many brand-new propositions were produced across all passes.
 * @property triggered Always true for a returned report; a threshold-gated skip returns `null`
 *   rather than a report with this set to false. Retained for forward compatibility.
