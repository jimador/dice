/**
 * A [CollectorStrategy] that marks propositions whose decayed confidence has fallen below a
 * staleness threshold.
 *
 * Rather than deleting anything directly, it reports a [MarkReason.Stale] mark and leaves the
 * actual decision to the sweep phase — which by default soft-transitions the proposition to
 * STALE rather than removing it.
 *
 * Stateless and read-only: the same candidates always produce the same marks, and the
 * repository is never consulted (the candidate set comes from the runner).
 *
 * @property retireBelow Effective-confidence threshold below which a candidate is marked stale.
 * @property retireDecayK Decay-rate multiplier for [Proposition.effectiveConfidence].
